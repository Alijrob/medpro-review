## Entry 001 — QLDB Vendor Lock-in: Accepted

**Date:** 2026-05-24
**Decision:** AWS QLDB is used as the immutable audit ledger despite vendor lock-in.
**Reason:** QLDB's cryptographic verifiability is non-negotiable for FCRA-grade compliance and legal defensibility. No open-source alternative provides this guarantee at scale with comparable security properties.
**Risk acknowledged:** AWS vendor dependency. Mitigated by streaming QLDB data to S3 for archival, and by using open-source alternatives (Kubernetes, OpenSearch, PostgreSQL) for all other layers.
**Locked in architecture:** Yes.

## Entry 002 — Auth0 vs. Okta: Unresolved

**Date:** 2026-05-24
**Status:** UNRESOLVED — architecture says "Auth0/Okta." Final selection must be locked before Phase 1-F.
**Impact:** SDK choice differs: `nextjs-auth0` vs. `@okta/okta-react`. Delay resolution past Phase 1-F start is a blocker.

## Entry 003 — Deployment Target: Unresolved

**Date:** 2026-05-24
**Status:** UNRESOLVED — Architecture specifies AWS EKS but no specific AWS account, region, or domain has been confirmed for this project.
**Impact:** Blocks Phase 1-B (Terraform skeleton) from becoming deployable. IaC skeletons can be written but not applied until this is locked.
